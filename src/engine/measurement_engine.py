"""Background measurement thread for the EmStat Pico MUX16.

Orchestrates electrochemical measurements in a QThread, keeping all
serial I/O off the GUI thread.  The engine builds a MethodSCRIPT from
the requested technique, parameters, and MUX channels, sends it to the
device, then reads the streaming response line-by-line, decoding data
packets in real time.  Decoded data points are emitted as Qt signals
for live plotting, and buffered into a MeasurementResult for post-run
export.

Abort, halt, and resume commands are forwarded to the device via the
thread-safe PicoConnection write methods and can be called from any
thread (typically the GUI thread).

Typical usage from the GUI layer::

    engine = MeasurementEngine()
    engine.data_point_ready.connect(plot_widget.on_data_point)
    engine.measurement_finished.connect(on_done)
    engine.start_measurement(connection, config)
