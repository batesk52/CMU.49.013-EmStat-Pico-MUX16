"""Sequential preset runner for the EmStat Pico MUX16 (CMU.17.034).

Drives a queue of resolved :class:`~src.data.models.TechniqueConfig`
steps back-to-back through the existing :class:`MeasurementEngine`, a
PSTrace-"Scripts" equivalent.  The runner never opens a second execution
path: it chains ``engine.start_measurement`` calls, advancing on the
engine's ``measurement_finished`` signal and gating on ``isRunning()`` so
the engine's single-run guard is honoured.

Design (see ``architecture.md`` -> "Preset Sequencer (CMU.17.034)"):

* The whole queue is resolved (and therefore validated by
  ``TechniqueConfig.__post_init__``) up front in :meth:`from_sequence`, so
  a Mode-C step with no usable RE/CE pairing fails before step 0 launches
  rather than mid-run.
* A step's ``repeat`` is expanded into that many queue entries; the
  step's ``delay_s`` is applied only AFTER the last repeat, inserted via
  ``QTimer.singleShot`` so the GUI event loop keeps spinning.
* ``sequence_mode`` is exposed so the main window can suppress the
  interactive export prompt. With a ``base_export_dir``, auto-saving
  entries (all of them when ``auto_save_all``, else just the
  provenance-forced EIS/GEIS steps) each write into their own
  ``<base>/<stamp>_sequence/stepNN_<technique>/`` dir — unique per queue
  entry including repeats, so same-second runs cannot collide — matching
  the end-of-run save prompt's layout exactly. Without a base dir the
  sequence runs without writing.

Signals:
    sequence_progress(int, int): Emitted as ``(completed, total)`` each
        time a step finishes (1-indexed completed count).
    sequence_finished(): Emitted once when every step has completed.
    sequence_error(str): Emitted when a step errors; the queue halts.

        Each step is resolved with :func:`build_config` (which validates

        repeats.  The step's ``delay_s`` lands only on the last repeat.
        Resolution happens eagerly so an invalid step raises here,
        before any measurement starts.

        Auto-save policy (requires ``base_export_dir``): when
